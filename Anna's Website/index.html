      <p>An exercise lover and plant based foodie who’s passionate about promoting a balanced, body positive & healthy approach to life.</p>
      <p>My love for exercise began growing up in Sydney where I was involved in so many sports and loved the active lifestyle - I once represented NSW in sports aerobics! After starting weight training more seriously about 6 years ago and dabbling in all kinds of fitness since, I love the way exercise makes me feel and the positive mindset it gives me. Nothing beats a fun & sweaty spin class followed by a delicious stack of homemade vegan pancakes drizzled with peanut butter, berries & maple syrup!</p>
      <p>I am a qualified Level 3 Personal Trainer, here to share my love for fitness, health & well-being and to help you achieve your goals too.</p>

      <h1>Veganism and Fitness</h1>
      <p>The question which I get asked the most, especially within the fitness community is “where do you get your protein?”. I was also concerned about this when I first changed my diet, but little did I know that plants have so much protein too! Beans, rice, quinoa, oats, tofu, broccoli, nuts, seeds & soya products just to name a few! In fact, everything has a certain amount of protein in it. </p>
      <p>Now that I train more regularly, I want to fuel my body appropriately and this is 100% possible on a plant based diet! I have honestly never felt better or had more energy. So I’d love to share with you what I’ve learnt over the years and help you achieve your fitness goals on a balanced, nourishing, delicious and abundant plant based lifestyle.</p>
