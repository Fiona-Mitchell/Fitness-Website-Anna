      <h1>Hi, I'm Anna!</h1>
      <br><br>
      <img src="images/portrait-2.jpg" alt="Anna Roberts Profile">
      <br>
      <p>I’m an exercise lover and plant-based foodie who’s passionate about promoting a more balanced, kind and inclusive approach to fitness and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>We all have different backgrounds, lifestyles, ambitions and priorities. There is no 'one size fits all' approach when it comes to our wellbeing, and because of this I tailor everything around you, your individual lifestyle and goals.</p>
      <p>Personally, I love the way exercise makes me feel and the mindset it puts me in. I do the things I enjoy, whether that’s dancing to my favourite tunes in my bedroom (or taking over the whole house…), weight training at the gym, going for a run in the sunshine, yin yoga or doing an online class and sweating it out alongside other people. There are so many ways to enjoy movement and I’m here to guide you to find what kind of movement sparks joy in your life right now. I hope that each session will leave you feeling empowered, strong (in whichever way the word strong means to you), accomplished and looking forward to the next!</p>

        <h1>Testimonials</h1>
<br>
        <p>“Training with Anna has helped me more than I can say. Her kindness and motivation has pulled me out of so many bad moments and I can’t say enough how much I appreciate her work.” <br>&nbsp &nbsp <b>- Shane</b></p>
<br>
        <p>“I have been training with Anna for around a year now and what a terrific year it’s been.<br><br> Anna starts by establishing goals based on your motivations and a psychology of doing more than just hitting numbers but being healthy and happy with who you are. Her program for me was terrifically tailored to a hectic lifestyle and she nailed my personal needs. Anna has been flexible around those needs but also strong in helping me push towards my goals.<br><br> She has a unique way of showing support and empathy - but staying dutifully firm in pushing me when I’m being lazy! She is terrifically encouraging and by far the best PT I’ve ever worked with. I thoroughly endorse Anna and know she can help you reach your goals – in the right way.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp <b>- Paul</b></p>
<br>
        <p>”Anna is absolutely fantastic - she is truly skillful - pushing me further and further without me realising. I really feel both relaxed and energised at the end of every session and I am so much stronger than when I started training with Anna. Anna really knows precisely how to train each muscle, she focuses on every muscle and movement - making sure I am doing each exercise properly. I find my sessions with Anna really rewarding and my body seems to work harder than a session at the gym! I feel so energised and calm at the end of each session - I really look forward to my sessions and I am achieving real results.” <br>&nbsp &nbsp <b>- Kristen</b></p>
<br>
        <p>“Before starting sessions with Anna I hated exercise but now I look forward to our sessions! Anna listens to what I like and don’t like but still makes sure that I’m working everything I need to. Would definitely recommend working with Anna!” <br>&nbsp &nbsp <b>- Louella</b></p>
<br>
        <p>“I loved my sessions with Anna! She really took the time to understand my goals and created workouts that were fun, challenging and motivating to help me achieve them. Her holistic approach to fitness and wellbeing is so refreshing and valuable, it really helped me enjoy looking after my body in a whole new way. I'd highly recommend training with Anna.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp <b>- Elin</b></p>

    <h1>Veganism and Fitness</h1>
<br>
      <p>The question which I get asked the most, especially within the fitness community is “where do you get your protein?”. I was also concerned about this when I first changed my diet, but little did I know that plants have so much protein too! Beans, rice, quinoa, oats, tofu, broccoli, nuts, seeds & soya products just to name a few! In fact, everything has a certain amount of protein in it. </p>
      <p>Now that I train more regularly, I want to fuel my body appropriately and this is 100% possible on a plant based diet! I have honestly never felt better or had more energy. So I’d love to share with you what I’ve learnt over the years and help you achieve your fitness goals on a balanced, nourishing, delicious and abundant plant based lifestyle.</p>
